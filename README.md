# UK South Wales and South West Channel and Scope Strategy

This document is an attempt at centralising and documenting the evolving strategy for this area's use of channels and scopes.

It's not an attempt to dictate what we do but rather document what we are doing.

## Current Situation

We are in a period of transition at the moment where the scope is only supported by more recent repeater firmware and app versions.

Until scopes are properly configured by the majority of repeaters in the region, 

## Setting a Scope

This can be done with the Repeater CLI - e.g. setting the ```#swsw``` scope:

```
region put #swsw
region allowf #swsw
region save
```

It can also be done with **Manage Regions** in the Repeater Admin screen
